## General Info

The website is the final JavaScript project for my post-graduate frontend developer course. It strives to meet all the requirements set forth by the lecturer, with just a tiny speck of my own invention.

## Technologies

I used HTML, vanilla CSS and JavaScript, and Visual Studio Code

## Setup

The website is available [on GitHub](https://karolgos.github.io/Projekt-Zaliczeniowy-JS-FDCDV/)

## Website's Logo

## Features

- Choose your dream car
- Add as many accessories and services to your cart as you wish
- When placing your order, make sure you've filled all the input fields, inserted your full name with a space in it and pick a delivery date that is no sooner than 14 days from now
- Admire your car once again on the debriefing page and wait patiently for your fake car to arrive!

## Project Status

A lot could possibly be done in terms of code optimisation and shortening. It would probably benefit from using Webpack for the code optimisation.
